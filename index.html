      <p>
        Thank you so much to the thousands of teachers and students who've
        piloted MathLeap inside and out of the classroom. We learned a ton
        this year about the unique needs of young math and science students.
        We're shutting down our service to turn 100% of our focus toward new
        products for education. Please don't hesitate to
        <a href="mailto:hello@mathleap.org">reach out</a> with any questions
        or concerns.
      </p>
