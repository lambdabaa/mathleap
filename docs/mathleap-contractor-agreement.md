This "independent contractor agreement" is made on ____________________ by and between ____________________ ("Contractor") and MathLeap Inc. ("Client"). Client and Contractor agree to the provisions of this contract as they apply to the services rendered (henceforth known as “work”) by Contractor.

The Contract’s provisions are undersigned by both Client and Contractor, and are as follows:

### 1. Relationship / Overview

### 2. Length of Contract

This contract begins on the date listed and can be terminated at will by either party at any time subsequent to the signing of the contract. Should both parties agree, the contract may be amended to alter the terms, provided that both Client and Contractor sign and date the amendment.

### 3. Payment

### 4. Insurance

As outlined in Section 1 (“Relationship”), Contractor is not an employee of Client.

Contractor further agrees to waive her right to hold Client responsible for any injuries that occur as a result of work during the duration of this contract.

### 5. Confidentiality

Contractor understands that entering into this contract with Client means that Contractor will come into contact with and/or learn about privileged information pertaining to Client. Contractor agrees not to divulge any of this confidential information to any third party without the expressed written consent of Client and to take reasonable security measures to prevent accidental disclosure and industrial espionage. Failure to keep such information private could result in legal action and/or revocation of the terms of this contract.

### 6. Non-compete Agreement
