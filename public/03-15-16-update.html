<h3><a id="Growth_0"></a>Growth</h3>
<p>In our 6 weeks live since we launched our public beta with Knox County Schools we’ve grown from 0 to over 2200 users.</p>

<p>In February, we won the demo competition at Startup Week PDX!</p>

<p>In March, we became a featured app in the popular Edmodo education marketplace and were invited to participate in the pitch competition at TechFestNW.</p>
<h3><a id="Product_12"></a>Product</h3>
<p>We’ve steadily built out our content from 13 to 35 question types by adding</p>
<ul>
<li>simplifying absolute value expressions</li>
<li>basic operations with fractions</li>
<li>basic operations with rational numbers</li>
<li>basic operations with polynomials</li>
<li>evaluating simple variable expressions</li>
<li>solving one variable inequalities</li>
<li>solving two variable linear equations</li>
</ul>
<p>Teachers also asked for an easy way to visualize class performance, so we’ve released performance insights for assignments!</p>

<h3><a id="Roadmap_to_Sustainability_28"></a>Roadmap to Sustainability</h3>
<p>Initially our plan was to offer a limited feature set and coursework to classes for free and sell districts premium subscriptions. After speaking to a number of startups and investors who’ve described selling to schools as immensely challenging, we’re making a small pivot.</p>
<p>The new plan is to provide all features of our class assessments product to teachers 100% free of cost. Since each teacher fans out to hundreds of students, providing a free product that automates grading for teachers is a great distribution strategy that we expect will put MathLeap in the hands of 100K+ students in the 2016-17 school year.</p>
<p>Once we reach 100K monthly active students, we’ll release a paid virtual tutor like Duolingo except for math and physical sciences. That product will</p>
<ul>
<li>diagnose students’ cumulative strengths and weaknesses</li>
<li>provide smart recommendations and exercises to students for improvement</li>
<li>predict key standardized test scores</li>
</ul>
<p>Our plan makes sense at this point in the educational software industry. ClassDojo CEO Sam Chaudary says “teachers are the key to the education marketplace[0]”. Classroom products can achieve great distribution but struggle to convert users from free to paid usage. On the other hand, existing tutoring products have struggled with distribution without teachers’ support in distribution.</p>
<p>However, the global tutoring market is &gt;$100B and MathLeap will have a much easier time growing internationally than other startups because mathematical concepts and notation are shared across languages. Our strategy of solving a teacher problem to get in front of millions of students and then selling tutoring and analytics to individual students marries the best of both worlds.</p>
